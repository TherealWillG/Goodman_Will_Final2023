## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Requires pygame and python to run. Tested on Windows 11
*** Please note, I was unable to make the images load in os and specify file paths, in order for this code to work, you have to download the folder named "Code Final." 
*** When attempting to run code, the folder named "Code Final" is the ONLY folder that can be opened. If the folder called "Code Final" is not the only folder open, and is within another folder, the code will not run as the images will not load
****** The VScode Tab should look like this:
